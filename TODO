Variations to the game:

Things to be present or not:
 - The scale labeling the notes
 - The name of the note to be repeated
 - The sound of the note to be repeated

So the sensible game modes are:
 - repeat the note: Everything is present
 - what's that sound: Scale and sound are present
 - hear that sound: name and sound are present
 - by the name: only name is present
 - by the sound: only sound is present

I think the only sensible way to input answer is to click around until you think you have the sound, and then click "guess" or whatever.

I guess there could also be a mode where you enter the name of the note by clicking the names, or typing them in.

No, it turns out I'm sticking with keeping the names of the tones visible and having users just click wherever to hear that tone, and the target tone again.
